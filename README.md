My first Flutter project.

## Introduction

This project is a starting point for me as a Flutter Dev.

This application is an Android Launcher which emulates an old keypad-style phone.

Apart from being a huge help for people starting off with an Android phone, this application can also serve as a Digital Detox by restricting the usability. 

## Features available


- Dial a number with the Phone app
- Select a contact from the Contacts app
